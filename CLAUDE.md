<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Stack
Runtime: Python 3.14 (backend), Node.js (frontend)
Framework: FastAPI + uvicorn (backend), React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (frontend)
ML: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, safetensors
Package manager: pip + venv (Python), npm (Node.js)

## Conventions
Components: PascalCase (React)
Functions: camelCase (TypeScript), snake_case (Python)
Commits: conventional commits (feat:, fix:, style:, chore:, revert:)

## How to run
Dev server:  npm run dev          (runs backend + frontend via concurrently)
Run tests:   py -3 -m pytest      (Python backend tests only)
Type check:  cd frontend && npx tsc -b
Lint:        cd frontend && npm run lint

## Testing strategy — TDD (non-negotiable)

This project uses test-driven development. For every PLAN.md item:

1. **Write the test first.** Write failing tests that encode the acceptance criteria before writing any implementation.
2. **Run the test, confirm it fails** for the right reason.
3. **Implement** the minimum code to make the test pass.
4. **Run the full test suite** — not just the new test.
5. **Refactor** if needed, keeping tests green.
6. Only mark the item done when the full suite passes.

Never write implementation before its test. Never commit code with failing tests.

## Autonomous execution rules (/yolo)

When running /yolo, work through PLAN.md:

1. Read PLAN.md at the start of every session.
2. Work through unchecked items `[ ]` sequentially — do not skip or reorder.
3. For each item, apply the TDD cycle above.
4. After completing each item:
   - Run the full test suite
   - Commit with a descriptive conventional-commit message
   - Check off the item `[x]` in PLAN.md
   - Append progress to STATUS.md (what was done, decisions made)
5. Before stopping for any reason, write/update SESSION_NOTES.md with:
   - What was completed this session
   - Design decisions made and why
   - What remains unchecked in PLAN.md
   - Anything the human must review or approve

## Circuit breakers

If any of these occur: stop the current item, document it in STATUS.md, commit partial progress, and move to the next PLAN.md item.

- A test fails more than 3 times on the same fix attempt
- A command errors more than 2 times consecutively
- A task needs a human decision (architecture, external API choice, etc.)
- A task requires a new dependency not already in the project

Never keep retrying the same failing approach. Document and move on.

## Definition of done

An item is checked off `[x]` only when:
- It meets the acceptance criteria written in PLAN.md
- New behaviour has tests, written test-first
- The full test suite passes
- The work is committed

## Security rules (non-negotiable)

- NEVER read, print, log, or reference .env files or files containing secrets
- NEVER run commands outside this project directory
- NEVER use `git push --force`
- NEVER run `rm -rf` on any directory
- NEVER print environment variable values — reference by name only
- If a task needs a secret that isn't available, document in STATUS.md and skip it
- Use .env.example for any secret references in committed code
- NEVER commit node_modules, build/, or dist/

## Git behaviour

- Work on the current branch unless PLAN.md says otherwise
- Commit after each completed item — do not batch multiple items into one commit
- Commit messages describe what changed and why
- Do not push unless PLAN.md explicitly says to push and open a PR

## What not to touch

- Do not modify .env files or .claudeignore
- Do not modify this CLAUDE.md unless a PLAN.md item explicitly requires it
- Do not install new dependencies without noting it in STATUS.md first
- Do not refactor files unrelated to the current PLAN.md item

## Token efficiency

- Prefer reading specific files over whole directories
- Use search/grep to locate code before reading full files
- Do not re-read unchanged files
- Keep this file under 200 lines — it loads on every turn
